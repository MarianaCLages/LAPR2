# US 4 - To register a test to be performed to a registered client

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a receptionist of the laboratory, I intend to register a test to be performed to a registered client.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**
> "Typically, the client arrives at one of the clinical analysis laboratories with a lab order prescribed by a doctor. Once there, a receptionist asks the client’s citizen card number, the lab order (which contains the type of test and parameters to be measured), and registers in the application the test to be performed to that client."

> "Many Labs perform two types of tests. Each test is characterized by an internal code, an NHS code, a description that identifies the sample collection method, the date and time when the samples were collected, the date and time of the chemical analysis, the date and time of the diagnosis made by the specialist doctor, the date and time when the laboratory coordinator validated the test, and the test type (whether it is blood test or Covid test)."
>
**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:**
> When the receptionist chooses the test type, should the categories appear, and then when selecting the category, the receptionist can choose the parameters for the test? Or when the Receptionist chooses the test type, should appear all the parameters that it includes immediately?
>
> **Answer:**
> Firstly, the receptionist should choose a test type. Then choose a category from a set of categories. Last, the receptionist should choose a parameter.


> **Question:**
> What are the attributes of a test and the acceptance criteria?
>
> **Answer:**
> A test has the following attributes: <br>
Test code : Sequential number with 12 digits. The code is automatically generated.<br>
NHS code: 12 alphanumeric characters.

> **Question:**
> Is the NHS code of which test is unique or not.
>
> **Answer:**
> Yes, it is

> **Question:**
> On the project description it says "Each test is characterized by an internal code, an NHS code, a description that identifies the sample collection method...". You said that the code is a 12 digit sequential number. Does this mean that, for example, the first test will have the code "000000000001" and so on?
>
> **Answer:**
> Yes.

> **Question:**
> On the project description we have multiple attributes of date and time ("date and time when the samples were collected", etc). Are these attributes filled by the author of the respective act or is it generated by the system when those acts are performed?
>
> **Answer:**
> The system should automatically generate the date and time of the event (test registration, chemical analysis, diagnosis and validation).

> **Question:**
> When the receptionist is registering a test for a client, the test can have more than one category and many parameters of the chosen categories, or it only can have one category?
>
> **Answer:**
> Each test can have more than one category.

> **Question:**
> Shouldn't the receptionist locate the Client by the Citizen Card Number instead of TIN Number?
>
> **Answer:**
> The receptionist should use the TIN number to find the client.

> **Question:**
> You've said on previous questions that the NHS code contains 12 characters and is alphanumeric, so this will be different from the NHS number from the client, am I right? If so, how do we know a certain test is associated to a client?
>
> **Answer:**
> A test has a NHS code and a client has a NHS number. In US4 the receptionist of the laboratory should ask the client to get his TIN number. Using the TIN number the receptionist of the laboratory can find all information about the client. Do not forget that a client should be registered in the system to make a test.

> **Question:**
> Can the client have two identical tests? or the system should stop from creating the same test?
>
> **Answer:**
> A test is unique in the system.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC1:** The receptionist must select the Categories and Parameters to be analysed from all possible Categories and
  Parameters in accordance with the test type.
- **AC2:** Client's Tax Identification Number must have 10 digits.
- **AC3:** Test Code must be a sequential number with 12 digits that is generated automatically
- **AC4:** Each test can have more than one category.
- **AC5:** The system should automatically generate the date and time of the every event
- **AC6:** NHS code have 12 alphanumeric characters
- **AC7:** A test is unique in the system
- **AC8:** The receptionist should use the TIN number to find the client

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

* There is a dependency to "US3- To register a client." since the client must be registered in the application to
  register their test.

* There is a dependency to "US7- To register an employee." since at least one receptionist must be registered in the
  application to register the test.

* There is a dependency to "US11 - To register a Parameter Category", to "US10 - To register a Parameter " and to "US -
  To specify a new type of test" since at least a type of test must be registered and consequently there must be
  registered ate least one parameter and one parameter category.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
    * client's citizen card number
    * Client's Tin Number


* Selected data:
    * Parameter Category
    * Parameters
    * Type of test

**Output Data:**

* List of Types of test in the system
* List of Parameters in the system
* List of Parameter Categories in the system
* (In)Success of the operation

### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and
outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Company
* Test
* Parameter
* Category
* TestType

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

* CreateTestUI
* CreateTestController
* TestStore
* ParameterStore
* CategoryStore
* TestTypeStore
* TestTypeMapper
* CategoryMapper
* ParameterMapper

# 4. Tests

*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of
requirements fulfilling.*

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is possible to create an instance of the Test class .

````

        Assert.assertNotNull(test);
    }
````

**Test 2:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Test class with null arguments .

````

**Test 3:** Check that it is not possible to save a repeated Test object (AC7) .
