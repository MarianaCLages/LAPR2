# US 12 - Validate the work done

## 1. Requirements Engineering

*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as
well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested capturing the requirements' acceptance criteria and
existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identify the involved input and output data and depicted an
Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*

### 1.1. User Story Description

*"As a laboratory coordinator, I want to validate the work done by the clinical chemistry technologist and specialist doctor."*

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**

> "After the specialist doctor has completed the diagnosis, the results of the clinical analyses and the
report become available in the system and must be validated by the laboratory coordinator. To
validate the work done, the laboratory coordinator checks the chemical test/result and associated
diagnosis made and confirms that everything was done correctly. Once the laboratory coordinator
confirms that everything was done correctly, the client receives a notification alerting that the
results are already available in the central application and informing that he/she must access the
application to view those results. The client receives the notification by SMS and e-mail. At the
same time the results are also available in the central application where the medical lab technicians
who collect the samples, the clinical chemistry technologist, the specialist doctor, and the laboratory
coordinator can check them."

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:**
> Should the laboratory coordinator validate the test results one by one or should he do only one validation of all of them?
>
> **Answer:**
>  The coordinator can validate all, or a subset of test results. The system does not show client personal information but shows all dates (test registration date, chemical analysis date and diagnosis date).

(insert others)

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

**AC1:** The system does not show client personal information but shows all dates (test registration date, chemical analysis date and diagnosis date).


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

This US is dependent of:

- **US4:** Since at least one test must be registered in the system.
- **US7:** Since at least one Laboratory Coordinator must be registered in the system.
- **US12:** Since the test must have associated results.
- **US14:** Since the test must have an associated report

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**

* Selected data:
    * Test to validate
    * Validation (true/false)

**Output Data:**

* Test results
* Test report  
* (In)Success of the operation

### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and
outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

*Use this section to capture other relevant information that is related with this US such as (i) special requirements
; (ii) data and/or technology variations; (iii) how often this US is held.*

## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt

*In this section, it is suggested to present an excerpt of the domain model that is seen as relevant to fulfill this
requirement.*

### 2.2. Other Remarks

*Use this section to capture some additional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design
activity. In some case, it might be useful to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams).*

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1         |							 |             |                              |
| Step 2         |							 |             |                              |
| Step 3         |							 |             |                              |
| Step 4         |							 |             |                              |
| Step 5         |							 |             |                              |
| Step 6         |							 |             |                              |              

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Class1
* Class2
* Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

* xxxxUI
* xxxxController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software
objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

![USXX-SD](USXX-SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes
that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

![USXX-CD](USXX-CD.svg)

# 4. Tests

*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of
requirements fulfilling.*

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values.

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in
accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of
other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*

# 6. Integration and Demo

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features
of the system.*

# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to
other alternatives and or future related work.*
