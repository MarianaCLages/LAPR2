# US 10 - TO CREATE A NEW PARAMETER AND CATEGORIZE IT

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

*As a specialist doctor, I intend to make the diagnosis and write a report for a given test.*

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications
**From the specifications document:**

> *"To facilitate and simplify the validation work performed by the specialist doctor, the application
uses an external module that is responsible for doing an automatic validation using test reference
values."*

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:**
> What characterizes a diagnosis? What it needs to have in it to be a valid diagnosis?
>
> **Answer:**
> The report contains the diagnosis. The report is free text and should have no more than 400 words.

> **Question:**
> Regarding the tests that the Specialist Doctor can write a report about. Should the SD chose from a list of tests? and Should him only receive a list of test that have completed all the previous steps?
>
> **Answer:**
> The system shows all tests ready (that have completed all the previous steps) to make the diagnosys and the Specialist Doctor selects one test. Then, the Specialist Doctor writes the report for the selected test.

> **Question:**
> If the report is not validated by the Lab Coordinator, can it be due to the report and diagnosis or are all of the reports and diagnosis written valid?
>
> **Answer:**
> I already answered this question.
> 
> 
### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- *AC1: The report is free text and should have no more than 400 words.*

- *AC2: The report contains the diagnosis.*

- *AC3: The Description is a String with no more than 20 characters.*

- *AC4: Each parameter has only one category.*

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

- *There is a dependency to "US12 As a clinical chemistry technologist, I intend to record the results of a given test" since at least the results of the given test needs to exist.*

### 1.5 Input and Output Data


*Input Data*
- *Typed data: Doctor's text*
- *Selected data: (test)*


*Output Data*
- *(In)Success of the operation*

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Test
* Report



Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:
* CreateReportUI
* CreateReportController
* ReportStore
* Report
* ReportStore
* Report
