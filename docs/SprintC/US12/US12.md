# US 12 - Record results

## 1. Requirements Engineering

*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as
well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested capturing the requirements' acceptance criteria and
existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identify the involved input and output data and depicted an
Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*

### 1.1. User Story Description

*"As a clinical chemistry technologist, I intend to record the results of a given test."*

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**

> "At the company's headquarters, the clinical chemistry technologist receives the samples (delivered by a courier) and performs the chemical analysis, recording the results in the software application"

> "To facilitate and simplify the validation work performed by the specialist doctor, the application uses an external module that is responsible for doing an automatic validation using test reference values"

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:**
> When the Clinical Chemistry Technologist wants to record the results of a test, how does he has access to that test? By internal code, NHS code?
>
> **Answer:**
> Each sample has a unique barcode. The clinical chemistry technologist should use the sample barcode number to find the test for which the sample was collected.

> **Question:**
> Should the system present a result for each test parameter or a single result for the test to be recorded?
>
> **Answer:**
> The Clinical Chemistry Technologist should register a value/result for each parameter of the test

> **Question:**
> From the Acceptance Criteria we get that "the API request should include, at most: (i) a key to access the module (e.g.: “KEY1234”); (ii) a parameter identifier; (iii) the reference date; and (iv) reference measurement unit (e.g. "mg")." Does this "at most" express that there are some parameters of the API request that are optional? If so, could you clarify the parameters that are optional?
>
> **Answer:**
> "At most" means the maximum number of parameters that will be used. Depending on the API being used, all parameters above may be required or some may be optional. Important: The number of parameters depends on the API that is being used.

> **Question:**
> The results of the tests can be negative or there are any restriction in this particular variable?
>
> **Answer:**
> The result/value of one parameter is related with the type of parameter we are measuring. To get an idea, please check the values returned by the external modules (jar APIs).

> **Question:**
> When you intend to record the results of the Blood Test, do you want to introduce all results for all parameters or just only one?
>
> **Answer:**
> The clinical chemistry technologist should record all results related to a test at a given time/moment.

> **Question:**
> According to the project description the external modules should be used by the specialist doctor when creating the diagnosis, so, shouldn't the acceptance criteria of the external modules be applied on US 014 instead of US 012?
>
> **Answer:**
> The reference values should be presented both to the clinical chemistry technologist (US12) and to the specialist doctor (US14). In the Project description we get: "To facilitate and simplify the validation work [make a diagnosis and write a report] performed by the specialist doctor, the application uses an external module that is responsible for doing an automatic validation using test reference values.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

**AC1:** The application should use an external module that is responsible for providing the test reference values. The
application can use an external module for each type of test. For instance, when the results are for blood tests
parameters, the externalize BloodReferenceValues1API can be used. When the results are for Covid-19 tests parameters,
the external module CovidReferenceValues1API can be used. In any case, the API request should include, at most:

- (i) a key to access the module (e.g.:“KEY1234”);
- (ii) a parameter identifier;
- (iii) the reference date;
- (iv) reference measurement unit (e.g. "mg").

**AC2:** The clinical chemistry technologist should use the sample barcode number to find the test for which the sample
was collected

**AC3:** The reference values should be presented both to the clinical chemistry technologist (US12) and to the
specialist doctor (US14)

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

This US is dependent of:

- **US4:** Since at least one test must be registered in the system.
- **US5:** Since the test must have an associated sample in the system.
- **US7:** Since at least one Clinical Chemistry Technologist must be registered in the system.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Step 3: Inserts the sample ID                       | ... search for the test associated with the sample        | TestStore                  | **
IE:** store knows all the tests and can ask the object for information                                                                                                         |
|                                                     | ... confirms that the sample is waiting for result        | Test                       | **
IE:** Test object knows its own state                                                                                                                                          |
| Step 4: Show parameters and asks to choose one      | ... transfer the parameter data from the domain to the UI | TestParameterStoreDTO      | **
DTO:** in order to detach the domain layer from the the ui layer we use a data transfer object in order to only extract data from the domain class and dont extract operations |
| Step 5: Choose parameter                            | ... get the TestParameter object chosen                   | Test                       | **
IE:** Test object knows all the TestParameter associated with it                                                                                                               |
| Step 6: Asks for results value and metric           |                                                           |                            |                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Step 7: Types results value and metric              | ... create the TestParameterResult object                 | TestParameter              | **
Creator:** TestParameter object contains ParameterResult object                                                                                                                |
|                                                     | ... get ReferenceValue for the Parameter                  | (interface) ExternalModule | **
Adapter:** Since the system needs to support different APIs we are using an interface and several adapters in order to be able to support them                                 |
| Step 8: Show all data and show successes            |                                                           |                            |                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Systematization ##

* Test
* TestParameter
* TestParameterResult
* External Module Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

* RecordResultUI
* RecordResultController
* TestParameterStoreDTO
* TestParameterDTO
* TestParameterStoreMapper

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software
objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes
that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

![USXX-CD](US12_CD.svg)

# 4. Tests

*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of
requirements fulfilling.*

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values.

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in
accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of
other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*

# 6. Integration and Demo

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features
of the system.*

# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to
other alternatives and or future related work.*
