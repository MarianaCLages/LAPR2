# US 12 - Record results

## 1. Requirements Engineering

*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as
well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and
existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identfy the involved input and output data and depicted an
Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*

### 1.1. User Story Description

*"As a clinical chemistry technologist, I intend to record the results of a given test."*

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**

> "At the company's headquarters, the clinical chemistry technologist receives the samples (delivered by a courier) and performs the chemical analysis, recording the results in the software application"

**From the client clarifications:**

> Insert clarifications after client answering

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

**AC1:** The application should use an external module that is responsible for providing the test reference values. The
application can use an external module for each type of test. For instance, when the results are for blood tests
parameters, the externalize BloodReferenceValues1API can be used. When the results are for Covid-19 tests parameters,
the external module CovidReferenceValues1API can be used. In any case, the API request should include, at most:

- (i) a key to access the module (e.g.:“KEY1234”);
- (ii) a parameter identifier;
- (iii) the reference date;
- (iv) reference measurement unit (e.g. "mg").

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

This US is dependent of:

- **US4:** Since at least one test must be registered in the system.
- **US5:** Since the test must have an associated sample in the system.
- **US7:** Since at least one Clinical Chemistry Technologist must be registered in the system.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
    * SampleID
    * Parameter Results
    * Metric

* Selected data:

**Output Data:**


* List of parameters 
* (In)Success of the operation

### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and
outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

*Use this section to capture other relevant information that is related with this US such as (i) special requirements
; (ii) data and/or technology variations; (iii) how often this US is held.*

## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt

*In this section, it is suggested to present an excerpt of the domain model that is seen as relevant to fulfill this
requirement.*

### 2.2. Other Remarks

*Use this section to capture some aditional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design
activity. In some case, it might be usefull to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams).*

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| :-------------                                      | :---------------------                                    | :------------              | :----------------------------                                                                                                                                                    |

|                                                     | ... coordinating the US?                                  | RecordResultsController    | **Controller** <br> **Pure Fabrication:** there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model                                             |
| Step 2: Asks for the code of the sample             |                                                           |                            |                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Step 3: Inserts the sample ID                       | ... search for the test associated with the sample        | TestStore                  | **IE:** store knows all the tests and can ask the object for information                                                                                                         |
|                                                     | ... confirms that the sample is waiting for result        | Test                       | **IE:** Test object knows its own state                                                                                                                                          |
| Step 4: Show parameters and asks to choose one      | ... transfer the parameter data from the domain to the UI | TestParameterStoreDTO      | **DTO:** in order to detach the domain layer from the the ui layer we use a data transfer object in order to only extract data from the domain class and dont extract operations |
| Step 5: Choose parameter                            | ... get the TestParameter object chosen                   | Test                       | **IE:** Test object knows all the TestParameter associated with it                                                                                                               |
| Step 6: Asks for results value and metric           |                                                           |                            |                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Step 7: Types results value and metric              | ... create the TestParameterResult object                 | TestParameter              | **Creator:** TestParameter object contains ParameterResult object                                                                                                                |

|                                                     |                                                           |                            |                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Test
* TestParameter
* TestParameterResult
* External Module
Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

* RecordResultUI
* RecordResultController
* TestParameterStoreDTO
* TestParameterDTO
* TestParameterStoreMapper

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software
objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes
that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

![USXX-CD](USXX-CD.svg)

# 4. Tests

*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of
requirements fulfilling.*

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values.

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in
accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of
other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*

# 6. Integration and Demo

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features
of the system.*

# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to
other alternatives and or future related work.*
