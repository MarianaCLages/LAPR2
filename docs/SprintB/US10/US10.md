# US 10 - TO CREATE A NEW PARAMETER AND CATEGORIZE IT

## 1. Requirements Engineering

*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identfy the involved input and output data and depicted an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*


### 1.1. User Story Description

*As an administrator, I want to specify a new parameter and categorize it.*

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

> *"Regardless, such tests rely on measuring one
  or more parameters that can be grouped/organized by categories."*


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- *AC1: The Code are five alphanumeric characters.*

- *AC2: The Short Name is a String with no more than 8 characters.*

- *AC3: The Description is a String with no more than 20 characters.*

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

- *There is a dependency to "US011 Create a Parameter category" since at least a category needs to exist.*

### 1.5 Input and Output Data


*Input Data*
- *Typed data: code, description and NHS identified*
- *Selected data: (category)*


*Output Data*
- *(In)Success of the operation*

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Company
* ParameterCategory
* Parameter



Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:
* CreateParameterCategoryUI
* CreateParameterCategoryController
* ParameterCategoryStore
* ParameterStore

# 4. Tests
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.*

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values.

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*

# 6. Integration and Demo

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*


# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
